Please update the existing code according to the following client branding and website notes:

🎨 Branding Notes:
1. Replace the red color that was previously added in the design with the official maroon color: #a80049.
2. Apply the official visual identity patterns and shapes throughout all pages.
3. The horse image should not appear fully — use it partially, similar to how it’s shown on the main profile page.
4. You may use the existing designs or images from the client’s profile if they fit the new layout.

📄 Page and Section Notes:
1. Home Page:
   - Simplify the services section to display 4 main boxes, each containing:
     - The service title
     - A short description
   - The detailed description of each service should appear on its dedicated service page.
2. Add a **“Values”** section to the home page.
3. Add a **“Steps”** section to the home page.
4. Replace the **“Testimonials”** section on the home page with a **“Success Partners”** section, but keep “Testimonials” as an optional section for later.
5. Add a **“Request Service”** icon/button that redirects users to a dedicated form page to:
   - Choose the service they want
   - Provide details of their request
   - Enter their contact information  
   This page should be separate from the “Contact Us” page.  
   Preferably, store the form data in an organized format (like a Google Sheet or similar).
6. Remove the **“Success Stories”** and **“Testimonials”** pages.
7. Add a **slider** on the home page to showcase featured projects; clicking on an item should navigate to the **Portfolio** page.
8. Redesign the **Portfolio** page to make it flexible and easy to update:
   - Allow adding multiple projects.
   - Each project should include:
     - Project name
     - Service provided
     - One or more uploaded files (images, videos, or general documents)
   - Support adding multiple items per project and multiple files per item.

🎨 Make sure the overall design aligns with the client’s official brand identity and the main maroon color (#a80049).
